# Simple Model for Smart Home
- This is a Repo for Simple Model for Smart Home ITI Embedded Diploma Graduation Project.

# Features
- This project involves constructing a Smart Home model with two ATmega32 microcontrollers. The first MCU manages door access via keypad input, while the second controls household devices upon successful entry. An additional security feature prompts the owner to input a password upon arrival; failure triggers a red LED and buzzer until the correct password is entered.


# Programming
- Smart Home is controlled using Atmega328p Microcontroller.
